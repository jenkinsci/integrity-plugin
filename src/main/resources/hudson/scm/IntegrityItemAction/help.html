	This post build action provides the ability to update the status of a build item in Integrity for Workflows and Documents.  Optionally, you may also store the contents of the build log with the item.
	
	<p>Additionally, this action will update an Integrity Test Session based on automated Tests executed after a Jenkins build.</p>
	
	<p>If the build configured as a 'parameterized' build, using the parameter name 'ItemID', then value for query definition is ignored!
	With build parameters enabled, builds can be triggered remotely using the URL: http://server/job/myjob/buildWithParameters?token=TOKEN&ItemID=1234</p>
	
	<p>If you do not use a "build" item, you may just invoke the test results capture by using the URL: http://server/job/myjob/buildWithParameters?token=TOKEN&SessionID=5678</p>
