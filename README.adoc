[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-info .confluence-information-macro-icon]##

Older versions of this plugin may not be safe to use. Please review the
following warnings before using an older version:

* https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-04-10/[Arbitrary code
execution vulnerability]

The PTC Integrity Plugin for Jenkins Integration is an open source
plugin that provides Jenkins Integration build capabilities for
https://www.ptc.com/en/products/plm/plm-products/integrity-lifecycle-manager[Integrity
Lifecycle Manager].

The plugin provides the following capabilities:

* Supports creation of builds from any Integrity CM Project
configuration (normal, variant, and build).
* Supports generation of continuous builds in Jenkins using file-based
changes or transactional change package-based changes in Integrity
Lifecycle Manager.
* Supports integration with local Integrity Lifecycle Manager client. 
* Supports specifying a Sandbox scope for transfer of specific
subprojects and/or members from the Integrity Lifecycle Manager server
to the Sandbox directory when the Sandbox is created or resynchronized.
* Tags support with a user defined tag name/pattern. For example:
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
${env['JOB_NAME']}-${env['BUILD_NUMBER']}-${new java.text.SimpleDateFormat("yyyy_MM_dd").format(new Date())}
----
+
A tag refers to an Integrity CM Project Checkpoint with a project label
and without propagation of the label to all members.
* Supports full or incremental workspace synchronization. The plugin
provides the option for a clean workspace that deletes the current
workspace and downloads a fresh copy from Integrity Lifecycle Manager
when enabled. If you do not enable the option for a clean workspace, the
workspace is updated based on changes found in the Integrity Lifecycle
Manager repository.
* Provides a detailed change log of differences for the current build
with an integrated SCM browser support. Change Log report links directly
to Integrity CM Annotated Member and Differences views.
* Polls Integrity CM on a cron schedule to check for any changes. If
there are changes, the plugin automatically initiates a build.
* Supports distributed/remote build execution. In a clustered Jenkins
environment, this plugin is designed to execute the checkout operation
on remote slaves.
* Supports Workflow plugins for Jenkins. For more information, see
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/PTC+Integrity+Plugin#PTCIntegrityPlugin-JenkinsWorkflowSupport[Jenkins
Workflow Support].
* Provides the option to update an Integrity Build item with the results
of the build. The plugin also provides the option to save the log
contents to a rich text field.
* Provides the option to update an Integrity Test Session item with the
results from a build's automated test execution.
* Updates Integrity Lifecycle Manager project/sub-project with output
from builds.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-Licensing]]
== Licensing

The PTC Integrity Plugin does not require any explicit license
currently. However, the mksapi.jar used by the plugin (to connect to
Integrity Lifecycle Manager server from Jenkins) is a proprietary PTC
jar and hence has its own PTC license. Integrity Lifecycle Manager users
get this mksapi.jar (and its license) bundled with the Integrity
Lifecycle Manager server.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-Development]]
== Development

Being an open source software, the plugin follows all standards for
being an open source software. The intention is to have a collaborative
software development where developers across community can contribute to
the plugin that benefits other users. PTC expects the community to
contribute to the development of the plugin and developers can submit
their code to the GIT hub location as pull requests. The submissions are
reviewed by PTC periodically and if deemed fit to be productized, PTC
will merge the submissions into mainline and release as a new version of
the plugin. PTC may, from time to time, contribute to the project as
well.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-Assumptions]]

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-InstallingPTCIntegrityPlugin]]
== Installing PTC Integrity Plugin

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-Prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

The installation of the PTC Integrity Plugin requires the following
prerequisites:

* Jenkins 1.609 server or a later server is installed.
* PTC Integrity Lifecycle Manager 11.0 server or a later server is
installed.
* API connections on the Integrity Lifecycle Manager server are enabled.
* For local client integration, Integrity Lifecycle Manager client is
installed locally on Jenkins instances, including both master and
slaves. For more information, see
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/PTC+Integrity+Plugin#PTCIntegrityPlugin-PTCIntegrityPluginLocalClientIntegration[PTC
Integrity Plugin Local Client Integration].

*Note*

* _The plugin uses the API exclusively to communicate with the
Integrity Lifecycle Manager server._
* _The plugin does not require the Integrity Lifecycle Manager client if
local client integration is not used._
* _The plugin install package includes the mksapi.jar (4.16.2671), which
is licensed under the PTC Freeware license. Please refer to ‘PTC
Freeware License Agreement.docx’ located inside the mksapi.jar file._

Consider the following when attempting connection to an Integrity
Lifecycle Manager 11.0 or a later server that is SSL-enabled:

* The Apache commons-httpclient library (jar) that is shipped with
Jenkins 1.609.1 or later is incompatible with the same library that is
packaged with the mksapi.jar.
* The version of commons-httpclient (packaged with the mksapi.jar) is
older than the version that is shipped with Jenkins. See PTC Customer
Support article
https://support.ptc.com/appserver/cs/view/solution.jsp?n=CS186156[CS186156]
for details about the issue. If you encounter an issue as described in
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31492[JENKINS-31492],
ensure that you follow step 5 as described in the PTC Customer Support
article
https://support.ptc.com/appserver/cs/view/solution.jsp?n=CS186156[CS186156].
* The incompatibility occurs only when attempting to connect to a
SSL-enabled Integrity Lifecycle Manager server. Do not attempt a jar
swap of the commons-httpclient library, if your Integrity Lifecycle
Manager server is not SSL-enabled.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-ConfiguringaBuild]]
=== Configuring a Build

To configure a build:

. On the Jenkins dashboard, select any existing build configuration or
create a new build job (as per your requirement). See the Jenkins
documentation on how to create a new build job.
. Select *Configure*. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Configure_Build.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453897563000&api=v2[image,width=326,height=311]#
. Navigate to the *Source Code Management* section.
. Select *Integrity* to configure the settings for the PTC Integrity
Plugin. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_SCM_Integrity.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453897704000&api=v2[image,width=285,height=104]#
. Define the following *Integrity* settings:
* In the *Server Configuration* field, select a connection profile. +
You can select a connection profile that you have defined as a part of
the global server configurations for Integrity in the Jenkins
configuration system settings.
* In the *Integrity Project* field, specify the Integrity configuration
management project or configuration path. +
You can specify a project using the old convention (specify full path to
_project.pj_). However, when referencing a development path or a
specific checkpoint, you must specify the configuration path convention.
You can build multiple projects using the downstream jobs feature of
Jenkins. +
*Note* +
_See Integrity Lifecycle Manager documentation or contact PTC Technical
Support for details on how to obtain the configuration path for variant
and build configurations._
* Select the *Use Local Client* checkbox to enable local Integrity
Lifecycle Manager client integration point. When this checkbox is
selected, the plugin does not use remote connections to Integrity
Lifecycle Manager server. For more information on integration with local
Integrity Lifecycle Manager client, see
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/PTC+Integrity+Plugin#PTCIntegrityPlugin-PTCIntegrityPluginLocalClientIntegration[PTC
Integrity Plugin Local Client Integration].
* Clear the *Clean Workspace* checkbox (default setting) if you want to
update an existing Jenkins workspace.
* Select the *Use* *Change Package Mode* checkbox to enable the change
package mode for the plugin. The *Change Package* mode enables the
plugin to detect changes made using change packages on the
Integrity Lifecycle Manager server repository for generating the builds.
By default, the plugin is configured to work in file-based changes mode
and considers the file changes for generating the build. For more
information on the Change Package mode, see
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/PTC+Integrity+Plugin#PTCIntegrityPlugin-ChangeDetection[Change
Detection]. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Integrity_Settings_2_1.png?version=1&modificationDate=1506425328000&api=v2[image,width=800,height=250]# +
 +
. Click *Advanced* and define the following advance settings:
* *Project Specific Username*
* *Project  Specific Password*
* *Include List*
* *Exclude List*
* *Restore Timestamp*
* *Line Terminator*
* *Omit Author in Change Log*
* *Checkpoint Before Build* +
*Note* +
_The plugin does not checkpoint Integrity CM build configurations. The
plugin only checkpoints normal or variant configurations._
* *Checkpoint Label*
* *Alternate Workspace Directory*
* *Synchronize Changed Workspace Files* +
*Note* +
_If you select the_ *_Synchronize Changed Workspace Files_* _checkbox,
the plugin generates and store checksums for files in the workspace.
When a build is executed either manually or due to a polling trigger,
the plugin uses the checksums to synchronize any changed or deleted
workspace files._ +
_If a polling trigger detects no changes for the Integrity SCM project
in the repository, but some workspace files are deleted or changed, then
the workspace files are not synchronized. This behavior occurs since the
checksum difference calculations are performed on the target file system
(or slave). Hence, the only time the workspace is actually synchronized
is during the start of the build (either manually or due to a change in
the Integrity SCM project)._
* *Delete Non Members*
* *Checkout Thread Pool Size*
* *Checkout Thread Timeout*
* *Repository Browser*
* **Sandbox Scope +
**A Sandbox scope determines which specific subprojects and/or members
to transfer from the Integrity Lifecycle Manager server to the Sandbox
directory when the Sandbox is created or resynchronized. For more
information about Sandbox scope, see the “_Specifying the Sandbox
Scope_” topic in the Integrity Lifecycle Manager Help Center and the
Integrity Lifecycle Manager CLI man pages for _si createsandbox_ and _si
configuresandbox_ commands. +
*Note* +
_To combine multiple Sandbox scope options using the logical AND
operator, specify the AND operator twice. For example, to include
project members with member attribute Beta AND name *.java, specify
attribute:Beta && name:*.java in the *Sandbox Scope* field. This option
is case-sensitive. Joining subproject scope clauses with a logical AND
operator is not supported as per Integrity Lifecycle Manager._
* *URL* (optional) +
*Note* +
_By default, the plugin defines a URL based on the specified
host/port/secure parameters in the_ *_URL_* _field. However, you can
specify the URL if you want to provide a different link for viewing the_
*_Annotated Revision_* _and_ *_Differences_* _views._ +
_If you are running the Jenkins server on the same server as the
Integrity Lifecycle Manager Server (not recommended), then you need to
override the value in the_ *_URL_* _field or access Jenkins using a
different URL. Integrity CM links do not work if Jenkins and
Integrity Lifecycle Manager are running on the same server and/or are
accessed with the same URL. However, you can access Jenkins with just
the hostname, (for example,_
_http://hostname:8080/[http://hostname:8080]) and Integrity Lifecycle
Manager with the fully qualified DNS name (for example,_
_http://hostname.domain.com:7001/[http://hostname.domain.com:7001]). PTC
recommends running the Integrity Lifecycle Manager server and Jenkins on
separate servers._ +

*Note* +

image::Jenkins_Checkpoint_Label.png[Build Scan link,width=60%,align="center"]
Jenkins administrators need to approve any potential unsecure groovy
script before execution of the script defined in the *Checkpoint Label*
field. For example, if you have a custom script evaluation in the above
field, it needs to be approved using *Manage Jenkins* *>* *In-process
Script Approval* (URL:
http://<jenkins-instance>:<jenkins-port>/scriptApproval), before the job
configuration can be saved.
. Click *Save* to commit your changes.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-ExecutingaBuild]]
=== Executing a Build

To execute the build:

. On the Jenkins dashboard, select an existing build configuration
(job).
. Select *Build Now* to start the build. +
If you configured your build job to use parameters (for example,
Integrity Lifecycle Manager Item ID), then select *Build with
Parameters*. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Build_with_Parameters.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453898964000&api=v2[image,width=699,height=455]#

If you want to check in artifacts from the build back into Integrity
Lifecycle Manager, specify how you are authorized to update the
Integrity project using the *ItemID* parameter values. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Parameter_ItemID.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453899039000&api=v2[image,width=1047,height=179]# +
Valid values for the *ItemID* parameter include:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
:none    // Indicates no change packages are used for check in
:bypass  // Assumes that the user has administrative privileges to bypass change package policies configured for the Integrity Project
0        // Same as :none above
12345    // An actual valid Integrity Item ID that the plugin will use to create a change package
----

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-MonitoringBuildProgress]]
=== Monitoring Build Progress

To monitor the build progress:

. In the *Build History* widget, select the build that you initiated to
monitor the progress. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Build_Progress.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453899121000&api=v2[image,width=607,height=440]#
. Click *Console Output*. +
The console output displays the details of the build in progress. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Console_Output.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453899217000&api=v2[image,width=1303,height=338]#

As highlighted in the above figure, if the *Clean Workspace* checkbox is
not selected, the plugin attempts to update the workspace by performing
the following operations:

* Downloading any changed files (includes adds/renames/moves)
* Dropping any files that are no longer needed (includes
drops/renames/moves)

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-ChangeDetection]]
== Change Detection

After the installation of the PTC Integrity Plugin, the first build
generated by Jenkins is considered as the initial build for reference.
The plugin detects changes made to the files in the Integrity Lifecycle
Manager server repository, and uses the file-based changes mode as the
default mode for change detection. However, you can configure the plugin
to detect changes that are part of the Integrity Lifecycle Manager
change packages, and generate the builds in Jenkins based on the change
packages detected.

For changes detected as part of change packages, the plugin considers
only transactional closed state change packages in the Integrity
Lifecycle Manager server repository after the last successful build. If
the existing build fails, the plugin considers the change packages that
are in closed state after the last successful build, for the subsequent
build.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-SelectionofFileModeorChangePackageMode]]
=== Selection of File Mode or Change Package Mode

For creating the first build, the plugin obtains the latest version of
the files from the Integrity Lifecycle Manager server repository to the
Jenkins workspace. You can then determine what change detection mode to
use: File mode or Change Package mode for the subsequent builds. Select
the Change Package mode for any change-package based changes in the
Integrity Lifecycle Manager server repository. For non-transactional
change packages, retain the default File mode. For more information on
the Integrity Lifecycle Manager change packages, see the _PTC Integrity
Lifecycle Manager Help Center_.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-Tagging]]
== Tagging

A ‘tag’ refers to an Integrity CM Project checkpoint with a project
label and without propagation of the label to all members. The PTC
Integrity Plugin supports tagging with a user-defined tag name/pattern.
For example:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
${env['JOB_NAME']}-${env['BUILD_NUMBER']}-${new java.text.SimpleDateFormat("yyyy_MM_dd").format(new Date())}
----

You can configure tagging in the Jenkins build job under a post-build
action. The following characters are not allowed in the *Checkpoint
Label* field of a post-build action:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
$
,
.
:
;
/
\
@
----

If you have configured the *Integrity - CM Checkpoint* post-build action
correctly, then you can view an entry in the console output after
successful completion of a build.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Successful_Build_Checkpoint.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453899371000&api=v2[image,width=1008,height=293]#

If you have configured the *Integrity - CM Checkpoint* post-build action
for a build configuration, the post-build action labels the project and
does not attempt to create a new checkpoint. The post-build action
performs a similar operation if you have configured the Jenkins job for
a pre-build checkpoint.

The following figure shows the project history view in Integrity CM
after successful completion of the build referenced in the console
output: +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Project_History_View.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453899945000&api=v2[image,width=434,height=445]#

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-Polling]]
== Polling

Based on the polling configuration for the Jenkins build job, the
*Integrity CM Polling Log* link is visible in the left-side navigation
pane. You can click this link to view details about the last poll. Refer
the following image for details about the last poll. For example, the
poll ran at 2:34 PM and found a total of 1 change (which includes
adds/updates/drops). +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Polling_Log.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453900120000&api=v2[image,width=704,height=728]# +
Also note that the new builds initiated as a result of the poll are
visible in the *Build History* widget.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-ChangeLogandIntegrityCMBrowsing]]
== Change Log and Integrity CM Browsing

The PTC Integrity Plugin provides a detailed Change Log of changes for
the current build with integrated SCM browser support. The Change Log
report links directly to Integrity CM Annotated Member and Differences
views. For example, if you select the build initiated by the SCM Polling
trigger, notice that the build was started by a SCM change.
Additionally, the *Summary of Changes* section lists out the details
(date and comments) obtained directly from Integrity CM. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_SummaryOfChanges_SCM.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453900702000&api=v2[image,width=730,height=324]#

Selecting *detail view* (as shown in the above figure) generates a
detailed report as follows:
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Changes_Summary.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453901077000&api=v2[image,width=924,height=182]#

The *Action* column provides an indicative icon about the change
(add/update/drop). Additionally, in the case of an update, you can click
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_EditAction.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453901220000&api=v2[image]#(Edit
Action) icon to access the Integrity CM member differences view.
Similarly, you can click the *Revision* link to access the Integrity CM
annotated member view. To view the change package details in Integrity
CM, click the change package ID links in the *C.P. ID* column.

*Note*

_The comments associated with the drop action refer to the last member
revision in the Integrity CM Project when you performed the drop action.
Currently, Integrity CM does not record comments when a file is
dropped._

For example, clicking the
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_EditAction.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453901220000&api=v2[image]#(Edit
Action) icon for member _IntegritySCM.java_ generates the Integrity CM -
Member Differences view as shown in the following figure:
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Differences.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453901384000&api=v2[image,width=1137,height=431]#

Similarly, clicking the revision link provides you access to the
Integrity CM - Annotated Member view:
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Annotated_Revision.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453901545000&api=v2[image,width=1134,height=606]#

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-RemoteExecution]]
== Remote Execution

The PTC Integrity Plugin for Jenkins supports build execution on remote
slaves. Currently, the plugin is designed to only execute the check-out
operation on a remote machine. All other commands are executed from the
Jenkins master server.

The remote build execution is virtually transparent from an SCM plugin
perspective. The only difference may be a different workspace path as
illustrated in the output from the following build executed on a slave
machine:
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_RemoteExecution_ConsoleOutput.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453901697000&api=v2[image,width=1139,height=278]#

No additional setup is required if the Integrity Lifecycle Manager
server is configured to allow API connections from any machine. If
Integrity’s API connections are configured for specific servers, ensure
that the respective Jenkins slave nodes are added to the list of allowed
connections on the Integrity Lifecycle Manager server.

*Note*

_If you switch building from the Master node to a Slave node or from one
Slave node to another Slave node, then you must select the_ *_Clean
Workspace_* _checkbox for obtaining a full copy of the source code from
the Integrity Lifecycle Manager server. This does not affect the ability
of the plugin to calculate the Change Log or generate the Summary of
Changes report._

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-PTCIntegrityPluginLocalClientIntegration]]
== PTC Integrity Plugin Local Client Integration

The PTC Integrity Plugin for Jenkins (version 2.1+) supports integration
with local Integrity Lifecycle Manager client (Integrity Lifecycle
Manager 11.0 and above). The integration involves installation of a
local Integrity Lifecycle Manager client on Jenkins instances (both
master and slaves). For more information on installing Integrity
Lifecycle Manager client, see the _Integrity Lifecycle Manager Help
Center_.

Integrity Lifecycle Manager client integration considers each job
workspace as a sandbox. Depending on the config path
(normal/variant/build) defined on the job level, the appropriate sandbox
is created in the workspace. All plugin functionality (for example,
checkout, polling, and so on) occurs in the workspace/sandbox.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-ConfiguringPTCIntegrityPluginforLocalIntegrityLifecycleManagerClientIntegration]]
=== Configuring PTC Integrity Plugin for Local Integrity Lifecycle Manager Client Integration

An Integrity Lifecycle Manager server compatible client installation is
required on all Jenkins instances for local client integration
functionality.

*Note*

_If multiple clients are installed, ensure that the client used by the
plugin is mentioned first in the PATH variable._

Consider the following when configuring the PTC Integrity Plugin for
local client integration:

* Jenkins service usually runs as LOCAL SYSTEM in a Microsoft Windows
environment. This can cause a problem during Integrity Lifecycle Manager
client startup in an integration environment. See
https://www.ptcusercommunity.com/message/479748 for more information.
You can resolve this issue by creating a dedicated Jenkins user in
Microsoft Windows and then adding the user to the Administrators group.
Use this user to start the Jenkins service in Microsoft Windows. For
more information on creating users and adding users to a group in
Microsoft Windows, see the Microsoft Windows product documentation.
* The local client integration uses the preferences specified in the
Integrity Lifecycle Manager client to connect to the Integrity Lifecycle
Manager server (or FSA server, if available). The server details and
authentication are fetched from the client if local client integration
is enabled for a job.
* The system level configuration of the Integrity Lifecycle Manager
server specified in Jenkins System Configuration is utilized in the
initial checkout step of executing si projectinfo command for the config
path and all the post-build steps. Ensure that the values of *Integrity*
server configuration options (hostname, port, username, password)
specified in the plugin match local Integrity Lifecycle Manager client
preferences.

The following parameters are supported when the local client integration
is enabled:

* *Clean Workspace*
* *Include List*
* *Exclude List*
* *Line Terminator*
* *Checkpoint Before Build*
* *Checkpoint Label*
* *Alternate Workspace Directory*
* *Sandbox Scope*

The following parameters are not supported when local client integration
is enabled:

* *Use Change Package Mode* (Not implemented for local client)
* *Restore Timestamp* (Not required for Sandboxes; only applicable to
remote client integration)
* *Omit Author in Change Log* (Not required for Sandboxes; only
applicable to remote client integration)
* *Synchronize Changed Workspace Files* (Not required for Sandboxes;
only applicable to remote client integration)
* *Delete Non Members* (Not required for Sandboxes; only applicable to
remote client integration)
* *Checkout Thread Pool Size* (Not required for Sandboxes; only
applicable to remote client integration)
* *Checkout Thread Timeout* (Not required for Sandboxes; only applicable
to remote client integration)
* *Repository Browser* (Not supported in local client integration)

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-IntegrityWorkflows&DocumentsIntegration]]
== Integrity Workflows & Documents Integration

The PTC Integrity Plugin for Jenkins facilitates end-to-end traceability
by recording build outcomes and automated test execution results. The
*Integrity-Workflow Item* post-build action provides the ability to
update the status of a build item in Integrity for workflows and
documents. Optionally, you can also store the contents of the build log
with the item.

Additionally, this post-build action updates an Integrity test session
based on automated tests executed after a Jenkins build. If you have
configured the build as a parameterized build using the parameter name
*ItemID*, then value for query definition is ignored. After enabling the
build parameters, builds can be triggered remotely using the URL:
http://server/job/myjob/buildWithParameters?token=TOKEN&ItemID=1234If[http://server/job/myjob/buildWithParameters?token=TOKEN&ItemID=1234]

If you did not use a build item, you can enable the recording of the
test results by using the URL:
http://server/job/myjob/buildWithParameters?token=TOKEN&SessionID=5678You[http://server/job/myjob/buildWithParameters?token=TOKEN&SessionID=5678]

You need to select the *Integrity - Workflow Item* post-build action
during build configuration to enable configuration options for the
following:

* Build Management +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Build_Management.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453901922000&api=v2[image,width=902,height=170]#
* Test Management +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/54723366/Jenkins_Test_Management.png?version=1&modificationDate=1453902031000&api=v2[image,width=883,height=273]#

The plugin can obtain build information or test results or both. If you
want to use the Test Management integration only, do not specify
anything in the *Query Definition* field and specify a *SessionID*
parameter for the build. The *SessionID* parameter is used to find the
Integrity Lifecycle Manager test cases and based on the *External ID*
field mapping (*Test Case Test Name Field External ID*), the test
results are populated in Integrity Lifecycle Manager. The *External ID*
field should reference the JUnit or other test ID using the appropriate
syntax. In the case of JUnit test results, the following are acceptable
forms of test case IDs:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
Default Package Example:  junit/(root)/TestCaseClassName/testCaseName

Package Example: junit/com.ptc.demo/TestCaseClassName/testCaseName

Java Package Example: com.ptc.demo.TestCaseClassName.testCaseName
----

If you want to integrate Build Management with Test Management, then
define a relationship field between the build item and the test session
(*Test Session Field*). The plugin first checks for the existence of a
build parameter *SessionID*. If it is absent, then the plugin searches
the *Test Session Field* relationship to determine how to locate a test
session item. This implies that the build automatically generates test
results. If there are no test results for the build, then the plugin
does not consider the Test Management configuration.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-JenkinsWorkflowSupport]]
== Jenkins Workflow Support

The PTC Integrity Plugin supports the Workflow plugin and associated
updated core Jenkins APIs. The following figures show the scripting of a
generic checkout step using the Workflow plugin's _Snippet Generator_.

Additionally, the PTC Integrity Plugin also supports three additional
workflow steps:

*Note* +
_Since the label step related to the SCM Label is executed independently
of the checkout step, currently there is no way to propagate the project
or checkpoint label to all subprojects. A project label can only be
applied to the top-level project._

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-Limitations]]
== Limitations

* The PTC Integrity Plugin 2.0.1+ does not support non-transactional
change packages in the Change Package mode. It is recommended to use the
file mode for non-transactional change packages by clearing the *Use
Change Package Mode* checkbox during the job configuration. For more
information, see
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/PTC+Integrity+Plugin#PTCIntegrityPlugin-ChangeDetection[Change
Detection].
* The PTC Integrity Plugin 2.0.1+ is designed to work with PTC Integrity
Lifecycle Manager 11.0 and later. There is no supported upgrade path
from earlier plugin versions to PTC Integrity Plugin 2.0+.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-TroubleshootingLocalIntegrityLifecycleManagerClientIntegrationIssues]]
=== Troubleshooting Local Integrity Lifecycle Manager Client Integration Issues

If you encounter the following error in the Jenkins job console:

....
Attempt to launch Integrity Client timed out. To solve this please try the following:
- Verify that the user you are logged in as has read and write permissions to the Integrity Client install directory.
- Make sure the Integrity Client install directory is the very first entry in the path.
com.mks.connect.BlimpException: Attempt to launch Integrity Client timed out. To solve this please try the following:
- Verify that the user you are logged in as has read and write permissions to the Integrity Client install directory.
- Make sure the Integrity Client install directory is the very first entry in the path.
....

* Ensure that the Jenkins service user has Administrator permissions or
the user is a network user.
* Terminate all Integrity Lifecycle Manager client instances running on
the Jenkins master and/or slave machines and execute the job again.

[[PTCIntegrityPlugin-BestPractices]]
== Best Practices

* The PTC Integrity Plugin uses an embedded derby database to store
cache information about an Integrity SCM Project. The size of this
database is dependent on the number of active Jenkins items (Jobs x
Builds). Hence, if disk space or performance of this embedded database
becomes an issue, it is necessary that you maintain a limited number of
builds.
* When switching between file-based changes mode and change
packages-based changes mode, you require an initial build that has no
build history for reference. To enable such initial build after
switching to file-based changes mode or change packages-based changes
mode, select the *Clean Workspace* checkbox during job configuration.
After Jenkins creates the initial build, you can clear the *Clean
Workspace* checkbox to prevent the creation of the reference build
again.
* It is recommended to select the *Delete Non Members* checkbox in the
*Advanced* configuration job settings to support the rename
functionality when using the Change Package mode.

*Note*: Performance of this plugin would depend on various factors (e.g.
Jenkins configuration, number of jobs, Job configuration, number of
plugins installed, hardware limitations, and so on).
